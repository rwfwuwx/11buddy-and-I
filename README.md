## What can they do for me ?
This would, much depend on what do you do and what do you need.

### Cognitive neuroscience research platform
#### Research
Suppose you work in Cognitive neuroscience, and/or related areas such as Psychology, Neural/Psychiatrical diseases.
Also assmue you are a lab PI, not necessary, just make the end-do-end research cycle more clear.

Now you conceive an idea, to test it, you decide to
- run **a behavior study**

- may also run **a scalp/intracranial EEG study**
  
  ![andy_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/f77af4d5-6e17-4c9f-ac85-054e086fa661) **andy** would be glad to do the job for you.

- may also run **a s/f MRI stidy**

  ![dahei_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/98640411-8e48-4103-92d5-e700f3307d0b) **dahei** would be glad to do the job for you.

- conduct **traditional/ML statistical analysis** on the results

  ![ada_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/aaa2a664-f765-4484-a7a4-2c556931479d) **ada** would be glad to do the job for you.

- **organize all the data/info**
  
  ![gougou_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/7cc3b7f6-daa6-4d30-9a89-c7a60bf1307d) **gougou** would be glad to do the job for you.

- [report your idea, e.g., as a paper]
  
  (xiaohu is on the way comming ...)

All together, 
- what you have decided and the according instructions sent to 11buddies formed, （we call it ）a **Study_TaskList**.
- by which 11buddies work with you, finishing your research.

#### Research - 'focus'
Sounds great... Well, you know, the 'publish or perish'? **Buddy, what exactly can you do for me**, hurry up.

...got it. Have a look at https://github.com/rwfwuwx/Xianglab-publication-code.

#### Teaching
You might be a teacher. 

Instead of the conventional interactions between you and students (*teacher-student*), why not to ask 11buddy to interact with students and you, i.e., *teacher-11buddy-student*?
