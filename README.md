## Who are they ?
(11buddy-&-I has been on https://gitee.com/rwfwuwx/elevenBuddy since 2021-01-29. From 2024, latest updates are now maintained here. 
The Gitee version may be lack of maintenance).

First meet with 11buddy.

## What can they do for me ?
This would, much depend on what do you do and what do you need.

### Cognitive neuroscience research platform
#### Research
Suppose you work in Cognitive neuroscience, and/or related areas such as Psychology, Neural/Psychiatrical diseases.
(Also assmue you are a lab PI, not necessary, just make the end-do-end research cycle more clear.)

Now you conceive an idea, to test it, you decide to,
- run **a behavior study**

- or run **a scalp/intracranial EEG study**
  
  ![andy_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/f77af4d5-6e17-4c9f-ac85-054e086fa661) **andy** would be glad to do the job for you.

- or run **a s/f MRI study**

  ![dahei_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/98640411-8e48-4103-92d5-e700f3307d0b) **dahei** would be glad to do the job for you.

- conduct **traditional/ML statistics** on the data

  ![ada_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/aaa2a664-f765-4484-a7a4-2c556931479d) **ada** would be glad to do the job for you.

- **organize and communicate with all data/info**
  
  ![gougou_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/7cc3b7f6-daa6-4d30-9a89-c7a60bf1307d) **gougou** would be glad to do the job for you.

- [report your idea, e.g., as a paper]
  
  (![xiaohu_icon](https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I/assets/60617251/784485d6-85f7-4072-a7e8-9c6572ca05ee)
 **xiaohu** is on the way coming ...)

All together, a **Study_TaskList**,

what you have decided and the according instructions sent to 11buddies formed（we call it）a Study_TaskList： with which 11buddies work with you, get your research done.

#### Research - 'focus'
Sounds great... Well, you know, the 'publish or perish'? **Buddy, what exactly can you do for me**, hurry up.

...got it. For example, have a look at https://github.com/rwfwuwx/Xianglab-publication-code.

#### Teaching
You might be a teacher, or a student.

Instead of the conventional interactions between the teacher and the student (*teacher-student*), why not to ask 11buddy to interact with either/both, i.e., *teacher-11buddy-student*?

(coming)

## anyway, Why 11buddy?
- “Hell is other people” (from No Exit) --- Jean-Paul Sartre.
  
  Why are people still there? Way get out there?

- Connection of info, not connection of people

  It is the connection of info that moves our society forward. Humans are one type of info carrier. Unfortunately, people forgot (or may have not realized yet), they are carriers of, but not the info per se. Therefore, instead of connection of info, they ask for connection of people; and stuck in Sartre's hell over and over.

Welcome to 11paradise,
